Thanks to it, the programmer does not have to manually release the memory occupied by unused objects, which significantly simplifies work and reduces the risk of errors. In this article we will look at the types of Garbage Collectors available in Java and their applications.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Garbage Collector is a mechanism built into the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that automatically frees memory occupied by objects that are no longer referenced. This prevents the application from leaking memory, and allows the programmer to focus on business logic instead of manually managing memory allocation and deallocation.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
